** Can we create variable directly into the class ? 

No we cannot we need to create a function within the class then we can create a variable. 

eg - :  here age is variable and title, position are property. 
   export class AppComponent {
  title = 'Hello Ankit Kumar Singh';
  position = 'Java developer';
  function (){
  let age = 20;
}

** What is package.json file ? 

The package.json file in an Angular project (or any Node.js-based project) is a metadata file that defines:
The project’s name, version, and scripts (run, build , test).
A list of dependencies and devDependencies.
It also defines the project structure. 

** Difference between dependencies and devDependencies in package.json file ? 

dependencies
These are the packages your application needs at runtime.
They are essential when the app is built, deployed, and running.

devDependencies
Used only in development, testing, and build tools.
They are not needed in production.

**Difference between tsconfig.json and tsconfig.app.json file ?


**What is tsconfig.json
Acts as the base config for all TypeScript builds in the project.
Includes Echema script version.
Includes global compiler options.
Other configs (like tsconfig.app.json, tsconfig.spec.json) extend this.


**What is tsconfig.app.json
Configures only the application source code (src/app, main.ts, etc.).
Used by Angular CLI when you run ng serve, ng build, etc.
Typically excludes tests, e2e, and node_modules.

**What is tsconfig.spec.json?

tsconfig.spec.json is for compiling test files.
It's used only when running tests (ng test).
It includes only *.spec.ts files and test-related TypeScript settings.
It extends the main tsconfig.json, just like tsconfig.app.json.

** What is angular.json file ?

angular.json controls how Angular CLI builds, serves, and tests your app.
It connects build tools with your source files and configurations (tsconfig.app.json, index.html, etc.).
It’s automatically managed by the CLI, but you can customize it if needed.

** What is interpolation ?
It displays data from TS to HTML file.
Executes JS code in html file.
Symbol is {{}}
But it has some limitations. (we cannot declare variable in interpolation, we cannot increament 
or decreament any variable, we cannot directly use loops for this we need to use ng-repeat).

** How to decide where we have write and code the associated ts and html file ?
So we have  [templateUrl: './app.component.html'] ,  defined in ts file which defines the associated html file. 

** What is Angular CLI ?
Angular CLI (command Line Interface) is a tool that helps developers to create, 
build,test, and deploy the Angular application. 
To install Angular CLI we have to run npm install -g @angular/cli in cmd. 

** What is components in Angular ?
Components are the building block of angular applications. They are responsible for managing a portion of the user
interface and its associated logic. It is mainly consists of four parts :-
TypeScript file, Html File, Css File and test(spec) file (for test cases).

We run 'ng generate component component-name' to create a new component, it gets created within our app folder.

** How to use one component into another component?

First we create a new component using the "ng generate component component-name" command.
We will have the ts, html and css file of the component, Then we write the code and then in another component ts file 
 imports: [LoginComponent], we import that component into the another component, we have to use the selector tag <app-login></app-login>
 into the component where we are injecting the other component. 
 
 
** How to use button click event in Angular ?
<button (click)="handleClickEvent()">Click Me</button>
Here handleClickEvent is function which handles the button click event. 


** What is Events in Angular ?
Angular utilizes event binding to enable dynamic interactions within web applications. This mechanism allows developers to connect user actions, 
such as clicks, keystrokes, and mouse movements, to methods defined in the component class. 
Eg- click, mouseleave, mouseenter, input, blur, focus etc.

**How to load multiple css file in one component ?
In the ts file we can add styleUrls array which can take mutiple css files to load this in one component.
